# Hospital Inventory Management

A Simple CRUD API developed using Express JS, Node JS, and MongoDB to manage hospital inventory.

It allows authorized users to add, update or delete ventilator details for different hospitals.

Ventilators can also be tagged with different statuses such as "occupied," "available," and "in-maintenance," and also filtered accordingly.

The application can also search for ventilators in a specific hospital.
